## ✅ Junior Security Analyst Intro  
Introductory simulation of SOC analyst workflows and responsibilities. Gained awareness of analyst tiers, alert handling, and the importance of documentation.

## ✅ Pyramid of Pain – TryHackMe
Completed the Pyramid of Pain room on TryHackMe.
**What I learned:**
- How the Pyramid of Pain helps prioritize threat intelligence indicators.
- The higher you move up the pyramid (e.g., TTPs, Tools), the more impact you have on an adversary’s campaign.
- The value of using high-fidelity IOCs (like behavioral patterns) over low-value indicators (like file hashes).

## ✅ Cyber Kill Chain – TryHackMe  
Completed the Cyber Kill Chain room on TryHackMe.  
**What I learned:**  
- The Cyber Kill Chain maps the steps adversaries take to carry out an attack.  
- Understanding each stage helps defenders disrupt or block attackers earlier in the chain.  
- The model is useful for both red and blue team strategies.

## ✅ Unified Kill Chain – TryHackMe  
Completed the Unified Kill Chain room on TryHackMe.  
**What I learned:**  
- The Unified Kill Chain combines the strengths of multiple models for a more complete view of adversary behavior.  
- It covers 18 phases across initial access, execution, and post-compromise.  
- Helps prioritize defensive efforts by identifying attack patterns and breaking them down.
