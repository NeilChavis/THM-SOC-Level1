## ✅ Junior Security Analyst Intro  
Introductory simulation of SOC analyst workflows and responsibilities. Gained awareness of analyst tiers, alert handling, and the importance of documentation.

## ✅ Pyramid of Pain – TryHackMe
Completed the Pyramid of Pain room on TryHackMe.
**What I learned:**
- How the Pyramid of Pain helps prioritize threat intelligence indicators.
- The higher you move up the pyramid (e.g., TTPs, Tools), the more impact you have on an adversary’s campaign.
- The value of using high-fidelity IOCs (like behavioral patterns) over low-value indicators (like file hashes).
